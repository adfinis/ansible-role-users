v0.3 (released: 2023-09-19)

Improvements:

 - users_root_password is now optional (not setting it will simply not change
   the root password on the system). users_root_password_salt is only mandatory
   if users_root_password is set (and users_root_password_is_hashed is false).

Documentation:

 - Changelog added, to allow better tracking of relevant changes for role users.

================================================================================

v0.2 (released: 2023-08-22)

Changes:

 - users_root_password is now expected to contain the unhashed password (and
   users_root_password_salt must be passed alongside, unless
   users_root_password_is_hashed is set to true).

Documentation:

 - Readme: Be clear about hashing the password
